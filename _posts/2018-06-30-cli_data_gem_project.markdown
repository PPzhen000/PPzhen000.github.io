Before I started working on the CLI Data Gem Project I was very excited and also utterly intimidated by this assignment. It was more than just an assignment for me, it was for the first time in my life I was able to build something that works. I am planning on doing some improvements to it by adding more functions to my app even it’s working fine now. I feel like it’s a great accomplishment since I started the program. It terrifying at first when my app is just a blank page. I had no idea how to build the entire application, how to correlate them, how to build a gem. I struggled to use the `bundle gem` command to build a gem in my local environment. I did a lot of research to figure out why I could only get an error message saying “bundle: command not found” when I followed exactly the installation guide from rubygems.org. After a few days of struggling, i decided to request a  1:1 tech support session to help me solve the problem. And I got an answer of “we don’t have the knowledge needed to set up our own environment yet and we can just build a new gem in IDE”. Okay, that was super helpful. If I were to know that few days earlier, I could have saved the few days of struggling on how to do the very first step. 

Bundle installing the gem only takes a few minutes. It is that easy, right? I know. I moved on to brainstorming out a game plan on how I want my application to function. In terms of picking out a topic, I chose something that I am the most familiar with, which is beauty bestsellers. Yup! Being a VIB member of Sephora for so many years did get me something. It took me around a little more than two days to finish writing all the coding  needed for my application. It was shorter than the time I used to figure out how to make a new gem. So my suggestion to those of you looking to start the project would be: 1. think of a topic you want to build your application around, 2.  find a website that doesn’t have a lot of JavaScript on it, 3. figure out in advance how to make a new gem on IDE and connect it to your github account. 

I had some other difficulties like finding the right CSS selector to get the information I wanted to scrape on and building the CLI class. I would highly recommend watching the DailyDeal walkthrough video included in the lab. It was very helpful to me and I watched it at 3 times. It not only shows me the process of making a new gem but I also gained some ideas about how to make my gem each time I watched it. 

That’s my experience. Hope you will find it helpful!
