My Uncle was a software developer at Motorola in Silicon Valley when I was around 16 years old. He used to visit us for the holidays every year. One year he impressed on my parents the value of owning a computer and knowing computer related skills for my ongoing education. Computers around that time were much much more expensive than they are now. He conviced my parents to buy a Dell desktop computer for around 2500 dollars which was a lot for my working class family to part with. Working with the family computer during what was now known as the infancy of the modern internet age was very exciting. 

Along with computer labs at school I could see that the computer field was a very vast subject area that people would struggle getting their head around. Computers are magical machines which no one would know the inner workings of is what I gathered when I was younger. They were a black box that required a secret code to unlock. Programmers were magicians that spoke in their own language and closely guarded their secrets. It seemed like computers were a engima that only a select few people knew how to unravel.

Years later when I was working with a project manager on the requirements for software for our lab in my previous job we had a long conversation with the engineer doing the coding. The project manager remarked that the program that he had built was simply astounding and the level of complexity amazed her. I could not help but totally agree with her and we exclaimed that the workings of the software seemed like magic to us. The way the software could carry out our business logic and meet all of the requirements in what was literally less than a second was mind blowing. It was at that time I realized that I needed to learn more about the white box that my parents bought for our family many decades before.

Now the time was right for me to stop looking on in amazement and give in to my curiosities. I have always wanted to study software development. I know it is not too late for me now and it will never be too late because I have always been fascinated by these Magical Machines.
