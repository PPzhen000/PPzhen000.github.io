I am very happy that I finally finished my Rails project. For this project I made a personal financial application call MyPocket. It is a web application that allows users to keep track of their income, financial activities on different categories and financial goals. The system will do simple calculations to show financial status of the user so users can see if your spending is on track for your financial planning. 

Before I starting working on the project I did not know what to do and felt hopeless.  What  app do I want to create? What functionalities do I want my app to have?  What models am I going to have? What are their associations? Would it be better if I do this... ? Getting started is always hard. 

Besides implementing the skills and concepts I have learned from the curriculum I felt like I also needed to do some research and teach myself some new techniques to build my app as what I want. I had planned on something pretty complicated, hoping to build a great app...lol... I thought that I might need to build a two level deep nested form for my main models with a has_many:: through association. In order to figure out how to do this I read countless articles and stack overflow posts. When I finally mastered the way to build a two level deep nested form I realized that itâ€™s better if I did not do the double nested form. Well...I just decided that I wanted to build a simple yet useful application. Getting started and finding the right track at the beginning is tough. I have learned that it is best to keep your options open at the beginning and find the right track that is the best for your app in the end.
