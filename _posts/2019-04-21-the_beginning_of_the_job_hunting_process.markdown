Finanlly comes the day! I officially declared my Job Search Start Date and decided to fully devote myself into job applications. I want to say... I am terrified. 

I don't know when I will land a job, when I will  hear from HRs, when I will get invitation to onsite interviews...

I don't know how much longer I need to feel intimidated by this process, how much I need to learn to get a job...

I was surrounded by question marks. 

> Looking for a job is a full time job by itself.

 I have heard it many times until I truly learn what it means when I started looking for a job in the new industry without a college degree. 
 
 I felt negative about myself.
 
 I am always a optimistic person and pretty good at clearing my mind of negative thinkings.
 
 But I have never felt so bad. 
 
Just when I was being super upset and suffering from imposter syndrome, the other side of me told me that maybe this is the time I should push myself out of my comfort zone. The process is tough because I am working towards something that's worthy of the efforts. It's better now than later to have mastery interview skills as I may  encounter numerous more job interviews later down the load. Better get good at it now than later. 

I start searching for videos about coping with stress during job hunting process and I found a good one.   ðŸ‘‡

It makes a good point that being successful means you need to be comfortable with failures. Get comfortable with feeling uncomfortable. Don't get terrified. Don't get intimidated. It's not gonna help with the situation. 

And that's the spirit I am going to carry with me along this job application process.
